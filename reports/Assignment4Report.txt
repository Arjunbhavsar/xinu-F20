Here we are using the concept of dynamic Programming to create fibonachchi series,
using the the concept of "futures".

We will use the mode FUTURE_SHARED to achieve the goal.

The main reason behind this is as follows,
    1) With the use of concept dynamic Programming our focus is mainly on reusing the stored values.
    2) In FUTURE_SHARED mode we are allowed to consume the produced values multiple time.
    3) Also after consuming the value from the future it will not change it's state from 
        FUTURE_READY to FUTURE_EMPTY it remains in FUTURE_READY state.
    4) And until the future is in FUTURE_READY state we can reuse the value of the future as many 
        times as wanted.

Example.  :
To get value 6 th digit in fibonachchi series.
    we will need to add values in fibfut[ 4 ] and fibfut[ 5 ]

Now, to get value in 7th digit fibonachchi series.
    we will need to add values in fibfut[ 5 ] and fibfut[ 6 ]

here, value for future fibfut[ 5 ] is getting called two times. 
Hence the FUTURE_SHARED mode is used.
